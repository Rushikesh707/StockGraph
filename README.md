# Real Time Analysis of market segment


# Introduction

In this project, I developed a financial data processing and visualization platform using ***Apache Kafka***, ***Apache Cassandra***, and ***Bokeh***. I used Kafka for realtime stock price and market news streaming, Cassandra for historical and realtime stock data warehousing, and Bokeh for visualization on web browsers. I also wrote a web crawler to scrape companys' financial statements and basic information from Yahoo Finance, and played with various economy data APIs. 



# Architecture

There are currently 1 tabs in the webpage:

- ***Stock: Streaming & Fundamental*** 
  - Single stock's candlestick plot, basic company & financial information;
  - Realtime S&P500 price during trading hours (*fake date* during non-trading hours)


&nbsp;


Here is the architecture of the platform. Note: the link in the image below is ***no longer available***.
